# Rosetta pipeline: A showcase and characterisation of pipeline frameworks

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/komparo/rosetta-pipeline.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/komparo/rosetta-pipeline)

[A lot of pipeline frameworks exist](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline), each containing a different (and sometimes exotic) syntax. Because of this, it can be confusing to choose the appropriate framework for a particular use case, which is further complicated by inconsistent terminology usage across frameworks.

Here we try to create:

- **[Example workflows for each framework with some common workflow tasks](tasks)**. They showcase how each workflow manager is used, and where the similarities and differences lie. This is inspired by [Rosetta code](http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code).
- **[A working document on the similarities and differences between pipeline frameworks](characterisation/overview.md)**. This document tries to introduce a consistent terminology of features that a pipeline framework can have, while also listing alternative names along the way. The discussion is meant to be neutral and objective, in the sense that it simply lists possible features of pipeline frameworks, along with some advantages and disadvantages of having that particular feature.
- **[A characterisation of the features of each framework](characterisation)**, structured in the same way as the working document.

## Structure

- [tasks](tasks) contains the task description and examples for each framework
- [characterisation](characterisation) contains the [working document](characterisation/README.md)
- [containers](containers) contains the dockerfiles for each framework. These are used for running the examples.

## Running the examples

1. Install conda and docker
2. Clone this repo
3. Install the conda environment: `conda env create -f assets/env/environment.yml`
4. Run snakemake: `snakemake`. A first build can take a while because all docker containers will be built.
