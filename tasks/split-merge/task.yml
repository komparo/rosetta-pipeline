    1. Split "elatyriaf.txt" into separate files .txt files.

    2. Reverse characters in each file and save

    3. Concatenate the reverse files into "fairytale.txt"

    Example in bash\:
    ```
    mkdir split
    split elatyriaf.txt -l 1 split/
    for f in split/*
    do
      rev $f > ${f}2
    done
    cat split/*2 > fairytale.txt
    ```

  - Static vs dynamic
