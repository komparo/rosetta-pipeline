# Comparing pipeline frameworks

[A lot of pipeline frameworks (aka workflow managers)
exist](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline), each containing
a different (and sometimes exotic) syntax.

This repo includes:

  - **[Example workflows for each framework](/examples)**, similar as
    done by the [Rosetta
    code](http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) project.
  - **[A working document on the similarities and differences between
    pipeline frameworks.](frameworks.md)**.
  - **[A characterisation of the features of each
    framework.](characterisation)**. It is structured in the same way as
    the working document.

We install and run each framework inside a [docker
container](containers). The complete set of examples can be run by
installing snakemake and by running `snakemake`. Make sure docker is
installed.
