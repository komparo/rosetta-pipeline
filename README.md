# Comparing pipeline frameworks

[A lot of pipeline frameworks (aka workflow managers)
exist](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline), each containing
a different (and sometimes exotic) syntax.

This repo lists for each framework:

  - [Some example workflows](/examples), similar as done by the [Rosetta
    code](http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) project. These
    are useful as a cookbook to compare workflow framework, and
    highlight their good aspects. All examples can be run using a
    snakemake workflow (see the [Snakefile](Snakefile)).
  - A characterisation of their features.

Docker files to install each workflow manager are provided in the
[containers](containers) folder. These are used for continuous
integration of the example workflows.
