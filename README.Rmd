# Rosetta pipeline: A showcase and characterisation of pipeline frameworks

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/komparo/rosetta-pipeline.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/komparo/rosetta-pipeline)

[A lot of pipeline frameworks exist](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline), each containing a different (and sometimes exotic) syntax. Because of this, it can be confusing to choose the appropriate framework for a particular use case, which is further complicated by inconsistent terminology usage across frameworks.

Here we try to create:

- **[Example workflows for each framework with some common workflow tasks](tasks)**. They showcase how each workflow manager is used, and where the similarities and differences lie. This is inspired by [Rosetta code](http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code).
- **[A working document on the similarities and differences between pipeline frameworks](frameworks.md)**. Terminologies are very diverse accross different frameworks, and this document tries to introduce a consistent terminology while also listing the possible alternatives along the way. This document is meant to be neutral and objective, in the sense that it simply lists possible features of pipeline frameworks, along with some advantages and disadvantages of having that particular feature.
- **[A characterisation of the features of each framework](characterisation)**, structured in the same way as the working document.

## Frameworks

```{r echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
list.files("tasks")
```

## Running the tasks

We install and run each framework inside a [docker container](containers). 
The complete set of examples can be run by:

1. Installing conda and docker
2. Clone this repo
3. Installing the conda environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
4. Running snakemake: `snakemake`
