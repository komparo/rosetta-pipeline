# Comparing pipeline frameworks

[A lot of pipeline frameworks (aka workflow managers) exist](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline), each containing a different (and sometimes exotic) syntax.

This repo lists for each framework:

- [Some example workflows](/examples), similar as done by the [Rosetta code](http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) project. These are useful as a cookbook to compare workflow framework, and highlight their good aspects. All examples can be run using a snakemake workflow (see the [Snakefile](Snakefile)).
- A characterisation of their features.

Docker files to install each workflow manager are provided in the [containers](containers) folder. These are used for continuous integration of the example workflows.

# Frameworks

```{r echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
# snakemake@params

# fs::dir_ls("examples")
