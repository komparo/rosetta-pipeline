# A comparison of pipeline frameworks

[A lot of pipeline frameworks exist](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline), each containing a different (and sometimes exotic) syntax. It can be confusing to select the appropriate framework for a particular workflow.

Here we try to 

- **[Example workflows for each framework](/examples)**, similar as done by the [Rosetta code](http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) project. These example workflow include common 
- **[A working document on the similarities and differences between pipeline frameworks](frameworks.md)**.
- **[A characterisation of the features of each framework.](characterisation)**. It is structured in the same way as the working document.

We install and run each framework inside a [docker container](containers). The complete set of examples can be run by installing snakemake and by running `snakemake`. Make sure docker is installed.

## Frameworks

```{r echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
# snakemake@params
# library(fs)
# fs::dir_ls("examples")
```
