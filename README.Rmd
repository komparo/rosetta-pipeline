# Comparing pipeline frameworks

[A lot of pipeline frameworks (aka workflow managers) exist](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline), each containing a different (and sometimes exotic) syntax.

This repo includes:

- **[Example workflows for each framework](/examples)**, similar as done by the [Rosetta code](http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) project.
- **[A working document on the similarities and differences between pipeline frameworks.](frameworks.md)**.
- **[A characterisation of the features of each framework.](characterisation)**. It is structured in the same way as the working document.

We install and run each framework inside a [docker container](containers). The complete set of examples can be run by installing snakemake and by running `snakemake`. Make sure docker is installed.

## Frameworks

```{r echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
# snakemake@params
# library(fs)
# fs::dir_ls("examples")
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of any kind. Some possibilities:

- Add a new example which highlights the advantage of a particular framework. Each example should contain a "run.sh" file which contains the command that will be run inside the container of the framework.
- Update or expand the working document.

A contribution implies that you agree with the [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
