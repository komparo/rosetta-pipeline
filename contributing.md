## Add a framework

To add a framework you need to:

1. Create a Dockerfile in the containers folder
2. Create a hello-world example in the examples/hello-world folder. See ["Add a new example"](#add-a-new-example) on how to add an example.

## Add a new example

Each example should contain a "run.sh" file which contains the command that will be run inside the container of the framework.
